# Face Detector with OpenCV and C# - Coding Challenge Series

Welcome to the Face Detector project, the second installment in our Coding Challenge Series! ðŸš€ In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to build a real-time face detector using OpenCV and C#.

## Overview

This project explores the fascinating world of computer vision, taking you through the process of creating a face detection algorithm from scratch. Whether you're a coding enthusiast, a beginner in computer vision, or just curious about facial recognition technology, this is the perfect challenge for you.

## Features

- **OpenCV Integration**: Harness the power of OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to implement face detection in real-time.
- **C# Implementation**: Code along with us in C# to build a robust and efficient face detection algorithm.
- **Testing and Visualization**: See the face detection algorithm in action as we test it with various images and video sources.
- **Challenge Yourself**: The code is designed to be beginner-friendly, but there's always room for improvement. Challenge yourself to enhance the project and take your skills to the next level.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/kerodkibatu/FaceDetection.git`
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the C# code in your preferred development environment. Make sure to configure the necessary settings and paths.
3. **Explore and Modify**: Dive into the code, experiment, and challenge yourself to improve the face detection algorithm.
